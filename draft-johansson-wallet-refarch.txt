1.  Introduction

   The term "digital wallet" or "digital identity wallet" is often used
   to denote a container for digital objects representing information
   about a subject.  Such objects are often called "digital
   credentials".  The use of the word "wallet" is both historic,
   stemming from the origin of some types of wallet in the "crypto" or
   digital asset community, aswell as meant to make the user think of a
   physical wallet where digital credentials correspond to things like
   credit cards, currency, loyalty cards, identity cards etc.  The
   wallet concept is a powerful conceptual tool and this document does
   not claim to define or constrain all aspects of the use of the term
   "digital wallet".  Instead this document is attempting to define a
   reference architecture for a type of digital identity architectures
   where a form of digital wallet is used to facilitate the flow of
   digital _identity_ credentials.  Specifically, this document does not
   concern itself with digital currency schemes or "crypto" wallets.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, BCP 14
   [RFC2119].

2.  A Note on History

   The origins of the notion of digital identity goes back to the mid
   1990s.  Historically, Internet protocols were designed to deal with
   authentication and (sometimes) authorization, i.e. the question of
   what entity is accessing the protocol and what they are allowed to
   do.  Digital identity can be thought of as a generalization of the
   concept of a user identifier in a protocol.  Today we typically use
   the term data subject (abbreviated as 'subject' when there is no risk
   of confusion) to denote the actor whoese data is beeing acted upon by
   the protocol.  Most internet protocols represent the data subject as
   a "user" identified by a single unique identifier.  Identifier in use
   by Internet protocols were typically never designed to be unified -
   each security protocol typically designed a separate structure of
   identifiers.

   Identifier schemes such as kerberos principal names or X.509
   distinguished names are often assumed to be unique across multiple
   protocol endpoints.  This introduces linkability across multiple
   protocol endpoints.  Historically this was never seen as an issue.

   When web applications were build that required some form of user
   authentication the notion of externalized or _federated_ user
   authentication was established as a way to offload the work involved
   in user management from each web application to some form of
   centralized service.  This is sometimes called "single sign on" - a
   term used to describe the (sometimes, but not alwasy desirable)
   property of authentication flows that a user can login in (sign on)
   once and have the "logged in" state recognized across multiple
   applications.  State replication across multiple web application
   carries with it a separate set of concerns which is not discussed
   here.

   In the late 1990s multiple protocols for "web single sign-on" were
   developed.  Soon the need to connect multiple "SSO-systems" across
   different administrative and technical realms was recognized.
   Bridging administrative realms is often called "federating" those
   realms and the term "federated identity" owes its origin to this
   practice.  The development of standard protocols for federating
   identity such as the Security Assertion Markup Language [SAML] and
   Open ID Connect [OPENIDC] were initially created in the early to mid
   2000s.  These protocols are widely deployed today.

   The notion of digital identity evolved as a generalization of the
   "single sign-on" concept because modern federation protocols (OIDC,
   SAML etc) are able to transport not only shared state about the sign-
   in status of a user (eg in the form of a login-cookie) but can also
   be used to share information about the subject (user) accessing the
   service.  In some cases identity federation protocols made it
   possible to fully externalize identity management from the
   application into an "identity provider"; a centralized service
   responsible for maintaining information about users and _releasing_
   such information in the form of _attributes_ to trusted services (aka
   relying parties).

   Federated identity can be thought of as an architecture for digital
   identity where information about data subjects is maintained by
   identity providers and shared with relying parties (sometimes called
   service providers) as needed to allow subjects to be authenticated
   and associated with appropriate authorization at the relying party.

   Here is an illustration of how most federation protocols work.  In
   this example the Subject is requesting some resource at the RP that
   requires authentication.  The RP issues an authentication requests
   which is sent to the IdP.  The IdP prompts the user to present login
   credentials (username/password or some other authentication token)
   and after successfully verifying that the Subject matches the login
   credentials in the IdPs database the IdP returns an authentication
   response to the RP.

   A brief illustration of the typical federation flow is useful.  For
   the purpose of this illustration we are not considering the precise
   way in which protocol messages are transported between IdP and RP,
   nor do we consider how the Subject is represented in the interaction
   between the IdP and RP (eg if a user-agent is involved).

   Subject -> RP: Initiate authentication flow
   RP -> IdP: Authentication request
   IdP --> Subject: Prompt for login credentials
   Subject --> IdP: Presents login credentials
   RP <-- IdP: Authentication response
   Subject <-- RP: Success!

   Note that

   *  The Subject only presents login credentials to the RP

   *  The IdP learns which RP the subject is requesting access to

   *  The RP trusts the IdP to accurately represent information about
      the Subject

   The limitation of this type of architecture and the need to evolve
   the architecture into direct presentation flow is primarily the
   second point: the IdP has information about every RP the Subject has
   ever used.  Together with the use of linkable attributes at the RP
   this becomes a major privacy leak and a signifficant drawback of this
   type of architecture.

   The notion of "Self Sovreign Identity" (SSI) was first introduced in
   the blogpost [PathToSSI] by Christopher Allen.  The concept initially
   relied heavily on the assumed dependency on blockchain technology.
   Recently there has been work to abstract the concepts of SSI away
   from a dependency on specificy technical solutions and desribe the
   key concepts of SSI independently of the use of blockchain.

   The purpose of this document is to create a reference architecture
   for some of the concepts involved in SSI in such a way that different
   implementations can be contrasted and compared.  This document
   attempts to define a set of core normative requirement and also
   introduce the notion of direct presentation flow to denote the
   practice of using a digital wallet to allow the data subject control
   over the digital credential sharing flow.

   Direct presentation flow should be seen as a generalization of the
   Self-Sovereign Identity concept in the sense that unlike SSI, direct
   presentation make no assumptions or value judgements about the
   relative merits of third party data ownership and control.  The basic
   architecture of direct presentation does empower the user with more
   control than the federated model does but in the SSI architecture the
   user always has full control over every aspect of data sharing with
   the RP.  This is not necessarily true (eg for legal reasons) in all
   cases which is why there is a need to desribe the technical
   underpinnings of direct presentation flows in such a way that the
   full SSI model can be a special case of a direct presentation
   architecture.

3.  Actors and Entities

3.1.  Subject and Wallet

   The subject (aka data subject) is typically a natural person but can
   be thought of as the entity associated with a set of data.  The
   subject controls a digital identity wallet (abbreviated as 'wallet'
   in this document).  The wallet is used by the subject to communicate
   with issuers and verifiers and acts as a container for digital
   credentials and presentation proofs.  The nature of the control the
   user has over the wallet varies but minimally the user must be able
   to initiate the receipt of credentials from an issuer and the
   transmission of digital credentials to a verifier.

3.2.  Credentials and Presentation Proofs

   A digital identity credential (abbreviated as 'credential' in this
   document) is an object representing a set of data associated with a
   subject.  The credential MAY contain data that uniquely identify a
   single subject.  A digital identity credential is typically
   cryptographically bound both to the issuer and to the wallet where it
   is stored.  A presentation proof (abbreviated as 'presentation' in
   this document) is a proof that a particular issuer has provided a
   particular set of credentials to the wallet.  A presentation can be
   verified by at least one verifier.  A presentation proof can be based
   on data present in a single credential or in multiple or even on the
   result of computations based on a set of credentials.  A common
   example is a presentation proof that a subject is legally permitted
   to take driving lessons.  This is a binary attribute the result of a
   computation involving knowledge of both the biological age of the
   subject aswell as legal restrictions that apply to the juristiction
   where the verifier is operating.

3.3.  Issuer and Verifier

   An issuer is a set of protcol endpoints that allow a wallet to
   receive a credential.  Credentials issued by the issuer are
   cryptographically bound to that issuer and to the receiving wallet.

   A verfier is a set of protocol endpoints that allow a wallet to send
   a presentation to a verifier.  A verifier is typically a component
   used to provide an application with data about the subject - for
   instance in the context of an authentication process.

4.  Direct Presentation Flow

   The basic direct presentation flows looks like this:

   group issuance
      Subject --> Wallet: <<initiate credential request>>
      activate Wallet
      Issuer <-- Wallet: request credential
      activate Issuer
      Issuer --> Issuer: <<generate credential>>
      return credential
      deactivate Issuer
      deactivate Wallet
   end

   group verification
      Verifier --> Wallet: request presentation
      activate Wallet
      Wallet --> Subject: <<prompt to select credential(s)>>
      activate Subject
      Wallet <-- Subject: <<pick credential(s)>>
      deactivate Subject
      Wallet --> Wallet: <<generate presentation from credential(s)>>
      return presentation
      deactivate Wallet
   end

   The wallet (acting on behalf of the subject) requests a credential
   from the issuer.  The way this flow is initiated is implementation
   dependent and in some cases (notably in [OIDC4VCI]) the flow often
   starts with the subject visiting a web page at the issuer where the
   subject is first authenticated and then presented with means to
   launch a credential issuance request using their wallet.  These
   details are left out from the diagram above.

   The credential is somehow generated by the issuer.  This is
   implementation dependent.  The claims in the credential typically
   comes from some source with which the issuer has a trust
   relationship.  The term "authentic source" is sometimes used when
   there is a need to distinguish the source of the claims in a
   credential from the source of the credential which by definition is
   the issuer.

   The wallet receives a credential from the issuer.  The credential is
   typically bound both to the wallet instance and to the issuer in such
   a way that presentation proofs generated from the credential can be
   used to verify said bindings.

   At some later point, the subject wants to use the credentials in
   their wallet to provide identity data to an application.  The
   application has a verifier (a specific software component responsible
   for verifying presentation proofs) associated with it.  The wallet -
   often after involving the user in some form of interaction to choose
   which credential(s) to use and what parts of the credential(s) to
   include - generates a presentation proof and sends it to the
   verifier.  The precise way this flow is initiated is again
   implementation dependent and in some cases (notably [OIDC4VP]) the
   flow starts with the subject visiting the application and hitting a
   "login" button which directs the users device to launch the wallet
   instance to complete the flow.  These details are left out of the
   diagram above.

   Upon receipt of the presentation the verifier verifies the issuer and
   wallet binding (aka holder binding) of the proof and - if the
   implementation supports revocation - the current validity of the
   underlying credential(s).  If successful the data in the proof is
   made available to the application.

5.  Normative Requirements

5.1.  Subject control

   The wallet SHOULD provide the subject with the means to control which
   data from a credential is used in a presentation proof.

5.2.  Selective Disclosure

   A conformant implementation SHOULD identify a format for representing
   digital credentials that make it possible for the subject to select a
   subset of the data present in the credential for inclusion in a
   presentation proof.

5.3.  Issuer Binding

   A verifier MUST be able to verifiy the identity of the issuer of the
   credential from the presentation proof.

5.4.  Holder Binding

   The verifier MUST be able to verify that the wallet sending the
   presentation proof is the same wallet that received the credential
   from which the presentation proof was derived.

5.5.  Non-linkability and data minimization

   The verifier MUST NOT be able to infer information about data or
   subjects not present in the presentation.  This includes any
   association between the wallet or subject and other issuers and
   verifiers not associated with the presentation.  In particular,
   colluding verifiers MUST NOT be able to infer data not present in
   presentation proofs.

5.6.  Revocation

   A conformant implementation SHOULD provide a way for an issuer to
   revoke an issued digital credential in such a way that subsequent
   attempts by a verifier to verify the authenticity of proofs based on
   that credential fail.

6.  Profiles

   Several profiles of this reference architecture exist.  We present
   two below.

6.1.  A Minimal Profile

   A minimal profile of the direct presentation credential architecture
   is as follows:

   1.  Digital credentials are represented as SD-JWT objects [SDJWT]

   2.  An issuer implements the OP side of [OIDC4VCI]

   3.  A verifier implements RP side of [OIDC4VP]

   4.  A wallet implements the RP side of [OIDC4VCI] and the OP side of
       [OIDC4VP]

   A wallet conforming to this profile is essentially an openid connect
   store-and-proove proxy with a user interface allowing the subject
   control over selective disclosure.

   This minimal profile fulfills several of the requirements in the
   previous section:

   *  Selective disclosure is provided by the use of SD-JWT objects to
      represent credential and presentation objects.

   *  Issuer binding is provided by a combination of digital signatures
      on SD-JWTs and OpenID connect authentication between the wallet
      and issuer.

   *  Non-linkability is provided by not reusing SD-JWTs from the issuer
      for multiple presentations.  The wallet MAY obtain multiple copies
      of the same SD-JWT credentials from the wallet at the same time.
      These can then be used to generate separate presentation objects,
      never reusing the same SD-JWT credential for separate verifiers.

   This profile does not provide any solution for revocation and it
   leaves the question of how OpenID connect entities (issuers,
   verifiers and wallets) trust each other.  There are also real
   scalability issues involved in how the digital signature keys are
   managed but as a minimal profile it illustrates the components
   necessary to make a direct presentation architecture work.

6.2.  The EU Digital Identity Wallet

   The EU digital identity wallet (EUID wallet) as defined by the
   architecture reference framework [ARF] is an evolving profile for a
   direct presentation architecture that includes several aspects of the
   minimal profile above.  Note that the EUID wallet specification is in
   flux and subect to signifficant change.

7.  Security Considerations

   One of the main security considerations of a direct presentation
   credential architecture is how to establish the transactional trust
   between both the entities (wallets, issuers and verifiers) aswell as
   the technical trust necessary for the cryptographic binding between
   the digital credentials and their associated presentation.  Digital
   credentials are sometimes long-lived which also raises the issue of
   revocation with its associated security requirements.

8.  IANA Considerations

   None
